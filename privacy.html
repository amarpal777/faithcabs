                                Faithcabs is transparent about the rates. Faith cabs makes sure that customers are aware of the dynamics of peak time charge and how it works. Whenever peak time charge is applicable; customers get a clear intimation, to confirm their intent to avail the ride at a higher price than normal. The booking process is initiated only when they confirm; hence, if a customer wants to avoid that ride he/she may choose to do it, thus making the cab available to others who are in need.
